# Step-by-Step Process for Bypassing Wi-Fi Restrictions

## 1. Use IKEv2 VPN(Windscribe)
- **Research IKEv2 VPNs**: Start by researching VPN protocols, with a focus on IKEv2 (Internet Key Exchange version 2). IKEv2 is known for its speed and reliability, especially on mobile devices.
- **Choose a VPN Provider**: Select a VPN provider that supports IKEv2. Ensure the provider offers strong encryption and a no-logs policy.
- **Install VPN Client**: Download and install the VPN client on your device (e.g., Windows, macOS, Android, iOS).
- **Configure IKEv2**: Set up the VPN connection using the IKEv2 protocol. This usually involves entering the server address, username, and password provided by the VPN provider.
- **Connect to VPN**: Once configured, connect to the VPN server. Your traffic will now be routed through the VPN, bypassing local Wi-Fi restrictions.

## 2. Use VPNs That Are Not Well Known(Quick VPN)
- **Avoid Popular VPNs**: Steer clear of well-known VPN services (e.g., ExpressVPN, NordVPN) as they are likely to be on the blocklist of restricted networks.
- **Research Lesser-Known VPNs**: Look for smaller, lesser-known VPN providers that are less likely to be blocked. Websites like Reddit, forums, and VPN review sites can be helpful in finding these.
- **Check Blocklist Status**: Before committing to a VPN, check if it’s been reported as blocked on the specific network you’re trying to bypass.
- **Test VPN**: Once you’ve selected a VPN, test it on the restricted network to ensure it works as expected.

## 3. Use Your Own VPN(Services like Linode)
- **Set Up a Personal VPN Server**: If you have access to a remote server (e.g., a VPS from providers like DigitalOcean, AWS, or Linode), you can set up your own VPN server.
- **Choose a VPN Protocol**: Decide on the VPN protocol you want to use (e.g., OpenVPN, WireGuard, or IKEv2). OpenVPN is a popular choice due to its flexibility and security.
- **Install VPN Software**: Install VPN software on your server. Popular options include OpenVPN, WireGuard, and SoftEther.
- **Configure VPN Server**: Configure the VPN server according to the protocol you’ve chosen. This usually involves setting up certificates, keys, and network settings.
- **Create VPN Client Configuration**: Generate a configuration file for your VPN client (e.g., .ovpn for OpenVPN).
- **Connect to Your VPN**: Use the configuration file to connect to your personal VPN server. Your traffic will now be routed through your own VPN, effectively bypassing the Wi-Fi restrictions.

## 4. Test and Verify
- **Test Access**: After connecting to the VPN, test your access to restricted websites or services to ensure the bypass is successful.
- **Monitor Performance**: Keep an eye on the VPN’s performance, including speed and stability, to ensure it meets your needs.
- **Stay Updated**: Regularly check for updates to your VPN software and server configuration to maintain security and functionality.

## 5. Stay Legal and Ethical
- **Understand Restrictions**: Be aware of the reasons behind the Wi-Fi restrictions. Bypassing them may violate terms of service or local laws.
- **Use Responsibly**: Use VPNs responsibly and only for legitimate purposes. Avoid activities that could be considered illegal or unethical.
